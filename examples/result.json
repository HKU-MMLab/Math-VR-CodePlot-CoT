The correct answer, per the provided answer key, is 68. The student presents a logical geometric analysis, exploring several approaches (Pythagorean theorem, areas, and division by diagonals) but ultimately concludes that the answer is 72 (option D), not 68. Their process includes relevant geometric observations but does not explicitly or accurately calculate the areas of S₁ and S₂ nor their sum, and ultimately their final answer is incorrect.",
