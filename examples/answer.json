    "0": "Given the figure:\n\n- The large square has side length 12.\n- Inside it, there are two smaller squares with areas \\( S_1 \\) and \\( S_2 \\).\n- We need to find \\( S_1 + S_2 \\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the figure\n\nThe large square is divided in a way that includes the two smaller squares \\( S_1 \\) and \\( S_2 \\), and additional right triangles or other shapes (not explicitly detailed but implied by the diagonal and arrangement).\n\n- \\( S_1 \\) is a smaller square inside the large square.\n- \\( S_2 \\) is another square, tilted, formed inside the large square.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Use Pythagoras or geometry to relate side lengths\n\nSince the large square has side length 12, its area is \n\\[\n12^2 = 144.\n\\]\n\nIf we can relate the side lengths of the two small squares to the large square, we can find \\( S_1 + S_2 \\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Observations\n\n- The diagonal of the large square is \\( 12\\sqrt{2} \\).\n- Notice that the two smaller squares \\( S_1 \\) and \\( S_2 \\) seem to fit in such a way that the triangle formed in between is right-angled.\n  \nIf we look carefully, the two smaller squares fit into the large square with a right triangle in between them, such that:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Side length of square with area } S_1 = a, \\quad \\text{side length of square with area } S_2 = b.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Pythagorean relation in the figure\n\nFrom the figure, the sum of the two smaller squares seems to be related to the division of the square's side or diagonal.\n\nConsidering the right triangles within the figure, the key observation is usually:\n\n\\[\na^2 + b^2 = (\\text{side length of large square})^2 = 12^2 = 144.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Check the options\n\nThe options for \\( S_1 + S_2 \\) are:\n\n- 60\n- 64\n- 68\n- 72\n\nNone of these is 144, so the above assumption \\( a^2 + b^2 = 144 \\) is incorrect.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Alternative interpretation: Sum of squares relates to half of the large square\n\nSince the smaller squares appear as subdivisions of the large square and its diagonal:\n\n- The diagonal of the large square is \\( 12\\sqrt{2} \\).\n  \nLet's consider if \\( S_1 + S_2 \\) equals half of the area of the large square:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times 144 = 72.\n\\]\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Final check\n\n- The straight line in the figure is the diagonal of the large square, which divides it into two equal right triangles.\n- The two small squares \\( S_1 \\) and \\( S_2 \\) are inscribed in these triangles.\n- Therefore, their areas likely sum up to half the area of the large square.\n\n---\n\n### **Answer:**\n\n\\[\nS_1 + S_2 = 72.\n\\]\n\n**Option D** is correct."
